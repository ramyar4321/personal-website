            I recently graduated from UBC with a bachelor in Computer Science. <br>
            Right after graduation, I wanted to enjoy a few months of 'me time' before <br>
            I permanently enter the work force, since I already of work experience. <br>
            During my free time, I enjoy various activities and hobbies,
            below are some of them.

                        Fallout New Vegas is a really great story driven game with rich dialouge, originally created
                        <br>
                        by Obsidian Studios. It is a role-playing game set in a post apocalyptic world. <br>
                        If you do get it, make sure to also get the Honest Hearts dlc.

                        Dark Souls 1 and 3 are the best pieces of medium I have ever <br>
                        experienced. If you love enviromental storytelling then I am sure <br>
                        that you will love DS 1 and 3. I haven't played DS 2 so I cannot comment on it.

                        Last but not least, KOTR 2. This game was also developed by Obsidian. <br>
                        Not really a Star Wars fan, but I thought I'd give it a try after play NV. <br>
                        It is very buggy and the mission designs are pretty boring but the characters <br>
                        and story are very well written.

                I like reading books. Through my school years I only read <br>
                science related books. However recently, I have been reading books outside of my field, <br>
                below is my current reading list. Hopefully, I will finish them <br>
                in due time.
