# My Personal Website #

Hello and welcome. Here you will find the code used to build my personal website. 

The main purpose of this project was to teach myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and to apply what I have learned into making a simple website. 

In my website you will find the following:

## About Me Page ##

This page will showcase a couple of my interests, namely video games and socializing. It will also show some of the books I plan to read.

## Resume ##

This page will simply show my resume. 

## Projects ##

Here are three projects that I have made over the past couple of weeks.

### Ordinary Differential Equations ###

Description: This page will allow the user to specifiy a ODE and boundray condition. Then the user can specify which approxiamtion methode to use, namely [Euler's Methode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) and [Runege-Kutta Methode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods).

Further Improvements: The page is bland and very uninviting. Creative changes need to be made to the HTML and CSS in order to make it more inviting.

### Game ###

Description: As simple game of avoiding the blocks for 50 seconds.

Further improvements: 
    1. Sometimes the game does not load, need to refresh the page. This might be a problem with the DOM not loading before the execution of the script.
    2. The game is bland. Sprit animations should be added.

### Stock Market Perdiction ###

Description: The program does the following:
    1. Collect stock data from API
    2. Clean the data and split it into train and test sets
    3. Create Reccurent Neural Netwrok and train it with the train set.
    4. Used the trained RNN model and run it against the test set.
    5. Plot the data for viualization.
    6. It may take a few minutes for the plot to load. Here are the results for the sake of saving your time: ![](img\stock_market_perdiction.JPG)

Further improvements:
    1. The RNN perdiction returns the same value for any input.
       This maybe due to choosing wrong hyper-parameters. This needs to be fixed.
    2. Potentially, use Convoluted Neural Network.
